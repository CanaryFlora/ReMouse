## Basic Guidelines:

# No Godot Mono / Godot C# / GDExtension scripts.
I am only experienced with using GDScript in Godot so i am not able to appropriately review scripts made with other languages.

## Style Guidelines:

# Formatting
Use camelCase for variables, constants and enums, snake_case for signals, methods and sprites, and PascalCase for autoloads.
