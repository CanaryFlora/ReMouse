snake_case for variable, function and folder names
PascalCase for enum declarations, class and node names
UPPER_CASE for constants and enum members

Use composition AND inhertiance; everything that does not need to rely on another component should be a seperate
component; everything that needs to rely on another component should extend it

For component registries in scripts, use seperate variables if it's for nodes with utilities whose methods will
be accessed and used later; otherwise, for data containers use arrays or dictionaries
